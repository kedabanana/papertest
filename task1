Displaying a World.

Create a World object. Can be resized within the window to show more "world".
in the world there are Deposits. They have  type and associated colour/shape, but ignore that for now.
Randomly place deposits in the world.
display deposits are circles for now.

Classes:

World:

#world size
Xsize
Ysize

#current viewport size, from bottom left?
windowx
windowy
windowsize


Deposit:

size
color
# current deposit location, from bottom left?
xloc
yloc



java script objects seem to defined as:

var Object = new function() {
   }
   

Start with world resizing... have it 5px less than all sides with a line around.
